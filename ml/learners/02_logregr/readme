 `-->this commands runs the basic commands mentioned below that executes the logistic regression classifier
     on the "astro-original" and "astro-scaled" TEST data set




BASIC COMMANDS TO VERIFY THE RESULTS IN THE REPORT:

ASTRO-ORIGINAL:
TEST
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --data ./data/astro/original/test --T 80 --rou 0.001 --s 100000 --wname optimal_astro_original --mode test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


ASTRO-SCALED:
TEST
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --data ./data/astro/scaled/test --T 80 --rou 0.001 --s 100000 --wname optimal_astro_scaled --mode test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


DETAILS OF ALL COMMANDS:

ASTRO-ORIGINAL:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TRAIN
python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --data ./data/astro/original/train --T 80 --rou 0.001 --s 100000 --wname optimal_astro_original --mode train

PLOT-NEGATIVE-LOG-LIKELIHOOD:
python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --data ./data/astro/original/train --T 80 --rou 0.001 --s 100000 --wname optimal_astro_original --mode plot

TEST
python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --data ./data/astro/original/test --T 80 --rou 0.001 --s 100000 --wname optimal_astro_original --mode test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



ASTRO-SCALED:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
TRAIN
python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --data ./data/astro/scaled/train --T 80 --rou 0.001 --s 100000 --wname optimal_astro_scaled --mode train

PLOT-NEGATIVE-LOG-LIKELIHOOD:

TEST
python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --data ./data/astro/scaled/test --T 80 --rou 0.001 --s 100000 --wname optimal_astro_scaled --mode test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Cross Validaiton:
Fold = 10

Hyper Parameters
1. Epochs, T Fixed to 80
2. Sigma,  s
2. learning rate r = f(rou,s)

The rule for SGD to have any gurantees is that 
The learning rate is not summable    sum (t=1 to infinity) r_t   = infinity
The learning rate is square summable sum (t=1 to infinity) r_t^2 < infinity
r(t, rou) = rou / (1 + rou*t/sigma^2)

Search Space for Hyper Parameters
1. T_range     = [80]
2. s_range     = [100,    1000,  10000,  100000]
3. rou_range   = [0.001,0.0001,0.00001,0.000001]

Commands used to perform cross-validation:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


ASTRO-SCALED:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

python ./src/logisticRegr/lrClassifier.py --mode cv --v 10 --data ./data/astro/scaled/train --wname astro_scaled
