## FD1D_HEAT_EXPLICIT_CFL: compute the Courant-Friedrichs-Loewy coefficient.
#
#  Discussion:
#
#    The equation to be solved has the form:
#
#      dUdT - k * d2UdX2 = F(X,T)
#
#    over the interval [X_MIN,X_MAX] with boundary conditions
#
#      U(X_MIN,T) = U_X_MIN(T),
#      U(X_MIN,T) = U_X_MAX(T),
#
#    over the time interval [T_MIN,T_MAX] with initial conditions
#
#      U(X,T_MIN) = U_T_MIN(X)
#
#    The code uses the finite difference method to approximate the
#    second derivative in space, and an explicit forward Euler approximation
#    to the first derivative in time.
#
#    The finite difference form can be written as
#
#      U(X,T+dt) - U(X,T)                  ( U(X-dx,T) - 2 U(X,T) + U(X+dx,T) )
#      ------------------  = F(X,T) + k *  ------------------------------------
#               dt                                   dx * dx
#
#    or, assuming we have solved for all values of U at time T, we have
#
#      U(X,T+dt) = U(X,T) + cfl * ( U(X-dx,T) - 2 U(X,T) + U(X+dx,T) ) + dt * F(X,T) 
#
#    Here "cfl" is the Courant-Friedrichs-Loewy coefficient:
#
#      cfl = k * dt / dx / dx
#
#    In order for accurate results to be computed by this explicit method,
#    the CFL coefficient must be less than 0.5!
